# Project Title

Model predictive control of Ball and plate system

## In this project:
I have used many tools such as ACADO, Matlab MPC toolbox, MPT. However, I make this project because I like the MPC and I want to understand how exactly MPC works, also I want to make it myself.

Motor controller:
* 3 stepper motors with driven by 3 Tb6560 modules and a STM32H7 nucleo (microstep mode: 1/16):
* The timers 1,2,3 used as PWM sources and master timers.
* The timers 4.5.8 used as slave timers which return the number of pulses generated by timer 1,2,3. 
* The slave timers can count up or down depended on the setup of the 4th bit of TIMx->CR1. 
* The number of pulses generated will equivalent to TIMx-> CNT.
* In my project, I used it instead of encoder for motors.
* The serial com used a array of 9 char -> 3 target angle which received from host computer.
* The STM32H7 Nucleo with control the motor using PID control.

Fast model predictive control for nonlinear system:

For loop:
* Using classic Runge-Kutta method (RK4) to calculate next 20 variables of X based on initial input U.
* Generate cost function and constrain funtions. 
* Evalute the cost funtion. If the input is satisfied: breed the for Loop and apply the input to the system.
* Caculate Gradient ( Numerical differentiation) and Hessian Matrix ( Gauss-Newton approximation): ( in the last project, I used a large number of variables: N * (Nx+Nu)+Nx, so the controller was very slow, thus in this project, I used number of free variables: N*Nu.)
* Solve the optimization using qpOASES
* Update U
* Repeat the loop.
The ball tracking with opencv is very simple so there is no discuss about it.

## Getting Started

Control of ball on plate using model predictive control with sequential quadratic programming and qpoases quadratic programming solver. 

### Prerequisites
Software:

* [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) - Visual Studio 2017
* [qpOASES](https://projects.coin-or.org/qpOASES) - QP solver
* [Opencv 3.3.1](https://opencv.org/releases.html)- opencv
Hardware:

* [Stm32H7 Nucleo](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-h743zi.html) - the Motor controller
* [TB6560](https://www.google.com/search?q=TB6560&rlz=1C1CHBF_enVN806VN806&oq=TB6560&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60j69i59l3.2159j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)
* [Webcam a4tech PK 720G](https://www.google.com/search?q=webcam+a4tech+PK+720G&rlz=1C1CHBF_enVN806VN806&oq=webcam+a4tech+&aqs=chrome.1.69i59l3.16687j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)


## Running the tests

In my full project, I will use a GUI made by QT tool in visual studio 2017 with this project to display and control system

The tests are controlling the ball which has the trajectories:

* Circle
* Stable at the known point
* As many as I can make
## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system

## Built With
* QT VS tool (GUI)
* Visual studio 2017
* Opencv 331
* STM32H7 Nucleo
* Logitech Webcam
* Stepper motor, ...

## Public
In coming ...
